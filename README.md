# iframe-loop

Recently i've been in a situation where i wanted to see only a specific part
of a youtube video. I didn't found out a way to do, so i created this code fraction that allows me to do it.
Iframe-loop uses user input to decide from which point the video will start and where it will end, then loops over
this frames selection.

The user can stop de the loop by pausing the video or reloading the page.
